Welcome to the **Dark Web Rust** repository! This project is a continuum work of the [black-hat-rust](https://github.com/skerkour/black-hat-rust) book. Here, you'll delve into the world of networking, implementing low-level protocols, including IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and much more topics. The primary focus is on hands-on hacking methodologies, providing a comprehensive learning experience through Jupyter notebooks. Each chapter in this repository is also available in PDFs, Markdown, and other formats.
