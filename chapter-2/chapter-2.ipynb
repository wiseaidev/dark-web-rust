    "# Chapter 2: Hidden Threads - Mastering the Art of Steganography in Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of this fascinating chapter lies the perplexing art of [**steganography**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), a term derived from the fusion of two ancient Greek words - \"steganos\", meaning \"to cover or protect,\" and \"graphien\", signifying \"to write.\" In the vast domain of [**cybersecurity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security), steganography serves as a captivating technique, like a digital cover, hiding valuable data within the seemingly innocent façade of images. This practice has become routine within the security community, a skill where practitioners adeptly navigate the delicate balance between hiding and disclosure. In essence, steganography empowers security professionals to embed payloads secretly, patiently awaiting the opportune moment for extraction once the data reaches its intended destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we kick off this chapter through the complexities of steganography, our focus sharpens on the security landscape, where the art of hiding and revealing data takes center stage. The essence of this practice lies in the ingenious hiding of information within the very fabric of images. Like a hidden message within a painting, steganography allows security practitioners to obscure critical payloads within the pixels of images, laying the groundwork for secret communication. This chapter, which is like a roadmap through the hidden passages of digital secrecy, reveals the techniques and procedures employed in this confidential art, offering insights into the methods that security professionals employ to navigate this delicate dance of data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chapter, like a guidebook for digital spies, delves into the practical aspects of this obscuring art, particularly focusing on the embedding of data within [**Portable Network Graphics (PNG)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) images. The PNG format, known for its ubiquity and versatility, becomes the canvas upon which the steganographer paints hidden messages. The journey through this chapter promises a deep dive into the complexities of PNG files, exploring their byte structure, decoding headers, and cracking the sequence of chunks that define the anatomy of these digital canvases. In essence, the chapter stands as a beacon for those navigating the maze of steganography, offering both theoretical insights and practical wisdom for concealing and unveiling secrets within the digital realm."

    "## 1. Exploring the PNG Format\n",
    "\n",
    "To kick off our journey of embedding data within the PNG format, we must first understand the complex byte curtain that constitutes a binary PNG image file. The PNG specification, accessible at [**libpng.org**](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Structure.html#PNG-file-signature), becomes our compass in navigating this digital landscape. Within this knowledge, byte chunks incorporate the fabric of PNG images, creating a canvas where our steganographic secrets will find their hiding places. These chunks, repetitive in nature, lay the groundwork for our exploration into the hidden domains of data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Enigmatic Header:**\n",
    "\n",
    "![ScreenShot taken from the Bless hex editor](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m9y570ydqf6j6f882lwf.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of PNG files, our journey begins with the opening eight bytes, forming the magical sequence \"**89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A**\". This sequence acts as a secret code, the key that unlocks the PNG world. Picture it like the first musical notes of our steganographic symphony. Now, onto the scene comes the `Header` struct, a kind of container designed to catch these magical bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// Header holds the first UINT64 (Magic Bytes)\n",
    "struct Header {\n",
    "    header: u64,\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Header` structure is like an artist's canvas waiting for a masterpiece. It holds an unsigned 64-bit integer, a perfect fit for the magical bytes. When we perform a magical act called [**transmutation**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html), the hidden message \"PNG\" is revealed, almost like a secret handshake granting us access to the **PNG** world. This Header is our guardian, making sure our PNG image is the real deal and giving us the green light to start our work of steganography. It's like the keeper of secrets, ensuring the symphony begins without any interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoding the Chunk Sequence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we venture beyond the surface of the PNG image, we encounter something known as the chunk sequence. This sequence follows structured data of **SIZE** (4 bytes), **TYPE** (4 bytes), **DATA** (variable bytes), and **CRC** (4 bytes). Each chunk is like a puzzle piece in the steganographic mosaic and contributes its unique narrative to the overall story painted within the **PNG** image. The **SIZE** chunk sets the stage, dictating the length of the upcoming **DATA**, while the **TYPE** chunk acts as a sign, revealing the purpose of the data that follows. Our mission is to decode this sequence, uncovering the hidden messages that lie beneath.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// Chunk represents a data byte chunk segment\n",
    "struct Chunk {\n",
    "    size: u32,\n",
    "    r#type: u32,\n",
    "    data: Vec<u8>,\n",
    "    crc: u32,\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we embark on the complexities of steganography within the PNG image, the `MetaChunk` structure emerges as our reliable companion, illuminating the path through the concealed landscape of digital storytelling. Picture the `MetaChunk` as our guide, equipped with the tools to decode the complexities hidden within each segment of our steganographic work.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// MetaChunk structure orchestrating the steganographic journey\n",
    "struct MetaChunk {\n",
    "    header: Header,\n",
    "    chk: Chunk,\n",
    "    offset: u64,\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MetaChunk` will navigate us through the hidden landscapes of binary complexities. Its fields, such as the `header` and `chk` (representing the Header and Chunk structures, respectively), are our compass and map, ensuring we stay on course through this steganographic work. The `offset`, is like a GPS coordinate, pinpoints our location within the byte landscape, marking the starting point of each chunk segment."

    "## 3. Hiding a secret in a PNG File\n",
    "In the domain of steganography, where plenty of sophisticated techniques exist for embedding payloads, our focus within this particular section will sharpen on the meticulous method of manipulating byte offsets. The PNG file format, our chosen format for this exploration, introduces a structured canvas outlined by additional chunk segments, each carefully defined within its specification. These critical chunks form the ground upon which the image decoder relies for seamless image processing. On the other hand, the additional chunks, while optional, contribute essential metadata that extends beyond the core encoding or decoding processes, including timestamps and textual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this complex framework, the additional chunk type emerges as an opportune target for the strategic injection of payloads. Its non-essential role in the image processing pipeline makes it an ideal candidate for manipulation. Whether through overwriting an existing chunk or delicately introducing an entirely new one, the potential for impactful alteration is vast. This sets the stage for a detailed exploration into the technique of seamlessly inserting new byte slices into the carefully delineated boundaries of an additional chunk segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To truly grasp the complexities of this method, we must delve deep into the anatomy of the PNG file format, which was already discussed in the previous sections. The critical chunks, acting as the digital scaffolding of the image, house critical data for the image decoder's effective functioning. Contrariwise, the additional chunks, characterized by their optional nature, impart an additional layer of functionality to the file by contributing supplementary metadata. This metadata, while not necessary to the decoding process, adds intrinsic value by encapsulating timestamps and textual details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deliberate selection of the additional chunk type as the focal point for payload injection derives from its non-critical identification. By opting to overwrite an existing ancillary chunk or introduce a completely new one, the image can be manipulated without compromising its core decoding functionality. In the subsequent sections, we will guide you through a meticulously detailed, step-by-step process, shedding light on the sophisticated art of seamlessly integrating new byte slices into the carefully chosen chunk segment. This journey aims to unravel the complexities of steganographic payload embedding, offering a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between manipulation and the complex landscape of PNG file structures."

    "### 3.1 Locating an offset\n",
    "\n",
    "To pinpoint an appropriate chunk offset, the initial step entails determining an appropriate location within the image data. Revisiting the hex editor, we proceed to walk through the original PNG file while moving toward the end of the image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within any valid `PNG` image, an `IEND` chunk type serves as an indicator for the terminal section of the file, signifying the end-of-file (`EOF`) chunk. Precision in this process involves advancing to the 4 bytes immediately preceding the final `SIZE` chunk, strategically situating yourself at the initiation offset of the IEND chunk. This marks the beginning of the arbitrary chunks - whether they be critical or not - encompassed within the overarching PNG file. It's essential to acknowledge that these chunks are optional, making it plausible that the file under examination may not exhibit the same chunks or might lack them altogether. In our illustrative scenario, the offset leading to the IEND chunk originates at an integer offset **159020**, as shown in the following image.\n",

This meticulous exploration ensures a comprehensive understanding of the file's composition, particularly when dealing with optional chunks that contribute to the overall complexity of the `PNG` format. In essence, this methodological approach establishes a foundation for precise offset identification, allowing for an examination of `PNG` files and facilitating informed analysis of their structural complexities."

    "### 3.3 Encoding a payload using a simple XOR operation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of steganography, where various techniques are employed to obscure data within binary files, an [**obfuscation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation) method plays a pivotal role. Building upon the groundwork laid in the previous sections, our focus now extends to enhancing the program with the incorporation of obfuscation techniques, thereby hiding the true value of the payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of obfuscation becomes particularly pronounced in scenarios where concealing the payload from vigilant network-monitoring devices and robust endpoint security solutions is imperative. Consider a scenario where a raw [**shellcode**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode), designed for spawning a new [**Metasploit shell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasploit), is being embedded. In such cases, evasion of detection becomes critical. To achieve this, the utilization of [**Exclusive OR (XOR)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) bitwise operations for both encryption and decryption of data emerges as a strategic choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "XOR, a conditional operation between two binary values, yields a Boolean true outcome only when the two values differ. Contrariwise, a Boolean false result is produced if the values are identical. The XOR truth table, as outlined in the following table, briefly captures this logic, where the output is true when either x or y is true, but not when both are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "| x | y | x XOR y |\n",
    "|---|---|---------|\n",
    "| 0 | 0 |    0    |\n",
    "| 0 | 1 |    1    |\n",
    "| 1 | 0 |    1    |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 |    0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "This XOR logic forms the crux of data obfuscation, wherein the bits in the data are compared to the bits of a secret key. The subsequent manipulation involves altering the payload bit to 0 when the two values match and to 1 when they differ. To implement this concept, the code from the previous section is expanded to accommodate an `xor_encode_decode` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn xor_encode_decode(input: &[u8], key: &str) -> Vec<u8> {\n",
    "    let mut b_arr = Vec::with_capacity(input.len());\n",
    "    for (i, &byte) in input.iter().enumerate() {\n",
    "        b_arr.push(byte.wrapping_add(key.as_bytes()[i % key.len()]));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    b_arr\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `xor_encode_decode` function, at its core, takes a byte slice representing the payload (`input`) and a secret key (`key`) as inputs. Within its scope, a new byte vector (`b_arr`) is initialized with a length equivalent to that of the input payload. Subsequently, a conditional loop iterates over each index position of the input byte array. During each iteration, XOR operations are performed by taking the current index's binary value and XORing it with a binary value derived from the modulo of the current index and the length of the secret key (`key`). This cleverly enables the use of a key shorter than the payload, as the modulo ensures that when the end of the key is reached, the next iteration reverts to the first byte of the key. The resulting XOR operation outputs are then written to the new `b_arr` bytes vector, which is ultimately returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical integration of these XOR functions into the existing program entails modifying the `main` function logic. The modifications, illustrated in the following code snippet, assume the use of command line arguments to dynamically pass values for conditional encoding and decoding logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn main() {\n",
    "    // ..\n",

    "        // Assuming encoding is requested\n",
    "        let encoded_data = xor_encode_decode(cmd_line_opts.payload.as_bytes(), &cmd_line_opts.key);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Calculate CRC for the encoded data\n",
    "        let mut bytes_msb = Vec::new();\n",

    "        bytes_msb.write_all(&encoded_data).unwrap();\n",
    "        let crc = crc32_little(meta_chunk.chk.crc, &bytes_msb);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Update the MetaChunk with the encoded data and CRC\n",
    "        meta_chunk.chk.data = encoded_data;\n",
