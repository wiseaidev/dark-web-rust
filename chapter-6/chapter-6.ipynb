    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the complex landscape of real-world [**web applications**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application), a fundamental aspect involves the storage and retrieval of data from [**databases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database). The orchestration of this data exchange requires the construction of [**SQL (Structured Query Language)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) statements by web applications. These statements are subsequently dispatched to the associated database, where they are executed, and the outcomes are then relayed back to the web application. The crux of the matter lies in the fact that SQL statements frequently encapsulate user-provided data. If the construction of these statements is not carefully handled, a vulnerability emerges, enabling an exploit known as [**SQL Injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).\n",
    "\n",
    "[**SQL Injection**](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) stands as one of the most common and evil blunders within the world of web applications. SQL Injection attack involves the careful injection of malicious code into the SQL statement, thereby manipulating the behavior of the database to execute unintended commands. This tricky manipulation of the SQL query can lead to [**unauthorized access**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security), [**data exfiltration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_exfiltration), or even the manipulation of [**sensitive information**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_sensitivity) within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive understanding of how SQL injection attacks operate is important for both developers and security practitioners. By the end of this chapter, you will gain insights into the potential entry points exploited by malicious actors seeking to compromise the security of web applications. In particular, we'll dive into attacking [**Rocket**](https://rocket.rs/v0.5) web apps, showing you how vulnerabilities play out in the real world. This hands-on experience is key for understanding how these attacks work, making you more savvy about keeping your apps safe."

    "### 1. SQL Injection Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with the generation of a SQL statement by the web application. This statement is typically constructed with user input data, a crucial point of vulnerability. When developers fail to implement adequate safeguards, attackers can exploit this weakness by injecting malicious SQL code directly into the input fields of the web application. The malicious payload becomes seamlessly integrated into the SQL statement, essentially working on the legitimate data provided by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider a scenario where a web application accepts user credentials for authentication. The SQL statement responsible for verifying these credentials might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' AND password = 'password';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the **username** and **password** are variables representing user-provided data. However, if the web application fails to properly validate and sanitize these inputs, an attacker could input the following credentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "' OR '1'='1'; --\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The manipulated SQL statement now becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'; --' AND password = 'password';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the injected code, the condition '1'='1' always evaluates to true, essentially bypassing the authentication process and granting unauthorized access to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To secure web applications against SQL Injection attacks, you must adopt a multi-step approach. Implementing [**parameterized queries**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html), [**input validation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sanitization), and utilizing [**prepared statements**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement) are pivotal defensive measures. Parameterized queries ensure that user-input data is treated as data rather than executable code, preventing any attempts at code injection. Input validation involves evaluating user inputs to ensure they adhere to expected formats, mitigating the risk of malformed data causing vulnerabilities. Prepared statements offer an additional layer of defense by separating SQL code from user-provided data."

    "### 4. SQL Injection Exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "To comprehend the vulnerabilities associated with SQL injection attacks, let's simplify the complex interactions between the browser, web application, and database. Imagine the web application creating an SQL statement template, leaving a blank space for the user to input data. Whatever the user provides in this space becomes an integral part of the SQL statement. The critical question is whether a user can manipulate the SQL statement's meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM users\n",
    "WHERE username=' ' AND password=' '\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The developer's intention is for users to fill in the blanks with data. However, consider the scenario where a user inputs special characters. For instance, if a user types the random string `'pass'` in the password entry and `user' --` in the username field, the SQL statement becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM users\n",
    "WHERE username= 'user' -- AND password= 'pass'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As everything from the `--` characters to the end of the line is treated as a comment, the SQL statement is now equivalent to:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM users\n",
    "WHERE username= 'user'\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Taking this a step further, let's explore the possibility of extracting all records from the database. Assuming we don't know all the usernames, we need to create a predicate for the WHERE clause that is always true for all records. Since '1=1' is always true, inputting `admin' OR 1=1` -- in the username form entry results in the following SQL statement:\n",

    "#### 4.1 Blind SQL Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "In the database security domain, [**blind SQL injection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Blind_SQL_injection) poses a daunting challenge. This phenomenon occurs when attackers interact with databases without immediate access to the outcomes of their actions, a scenario often encountered in the absence of record outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An illustrative instance of blind SQL injection lies in the [**authentication**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) bypass, although its scope extends beyond such scenarios. The technique involves an [**inference attack**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_attack), in which attackers, lacking direct visibility into the database responses, strategically attempt to leak information through logical assumptions derived from web responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key tactic employed in blind SQL injection is the introduction of an arbitrary time delay in the query submission. This strategic delay serves as an initiation test for an application's vulnerability to SQL injection. By inspecting the application's response time, an attacker can recognise potential vulnerabilities.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Further complexities come from boolean-based blind injection, where attackers manipulate statements that could be true or false. By observing variations in the application's responses to injected statements, attackers can deduce the presence of vulnerabilities and subsequently manipulate the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-based SQL injection introduces an additional layer of sophistication. In instances where true and false results lack detectable differences, attackers leverage functions such as [`sqlite3_sleep`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/sleep.html) to artificially delay query execution. This method introduces a temporal element, where, for example, the application may pause for a specified duration before responding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases have different functionalities in this context. SQLITE does not have a native `SLEEP` function like some other database management systems (e.g. MYSQL). However, you can achieve a similar delay using a combination of the `SELECT` statement and the `sqlite3_sleep` extension function. Let's create a sleep-like delay in SQLite:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT sqlite3_sleep(3000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `sqlite3_sleep(3000)` pauses the execution for 3000 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 3 seconds. The combination of time delays and Boolean queries becomes a powerful strategy, where an attacker may construct queries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT IF substring(field,1,1)='val' sqlite3_sleep(3000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "relying on the delay gap in responses as a critical signal. An additional tactic, known as **splitting and balancing**, involves crafting functionally identical queries that appear different. This technique allows attackers to inject additional queries while maintaining the integrity of parentheses and quotes, thereby generating legitimate SQL queries. Imagine a scenario where an attacker seeks to manipulate a database through the following safe-looking query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the attacker wants to inject additional queries carefully while ensuring the overall query remains syntactically valid. The following is an example of how they might utilize the **splitting and balancing** technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Original Query\n",
    "SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Functionally Identical Query (Different Appearance)\n",
    "SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = 2-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the second query appears different due to the arithmetic operation (`2-1`), but it is functionally identical to the original query. The attacker has injected their manipulation by maintaining the balance of parentheses and quotes. This ensures that the injected query, though seemingly different, aligns with the expected SQL syntax, thereby allowing the attacker to introduce additional queries without triggering syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the magic happens when the attacker exploits this technique to introduce more complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Original Query\n",
    "SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Functionally Identical Query with a Nested Sub-Query (Disguised)\n",
    "SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = 1 + (SELECT password FROM users WHERE user_id = 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the appearance of the query hides the true nature of the injected query. The attacker can now insert nested sub-queries between parentheses, orchestrating a series of operations while keeping the obvious appearance consistent with legitimate SQL syntax."

    "In the previous section, we have explored sql injection using forms. However, it's often more convenient to utilize a command-line tool for automation. [**cURL**](https://curl.se/) is a widely-known command-line utility for sending data over various network protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS. Using cURL, we can send a form from the command line rather than a web page. Consider the following example:\n",

    "#### 5.1 Blind Based cURL SQL Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned from the previous sections, in SQLite, time-based SQL injection can be trickier because SQLite does not have a built-in `SLEEP` function like other database management systems. However, you can leverage certain functions or tasks that take time to execute. Here's an example using SQLite:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ curl -X POST \\\n",
    "     -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n",
    "     --data-urlencode \"username=admin' AND SELECT sqlite3_sleep(3000) --\" \\\n",
    "     --data-urlencode \"password=pass\" \\\n",
    "     http://127.0.0.1:8000/login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the payload includes a subquery using `sqlite3_sleep(3000)` within a `CASE` statement. If the condition `(1=1)` is true, it will execute the sleep function, causing a delay. If false, it performs `0`. The `--` at the end is used to comment out the remainder of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider a basic example of using cURL for a time-based SQL injection with the splitting and balancing technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ curl -X POST \\\n",
    "     -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n",
    "     --data-urlencode \"username=admin' AND (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE username = 'admin') = 1 --\" \\\n",
    "     --data-urlencode \"password=pass\" \\\n",
    "     http://127.0.0.1:8000/login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the payload attempts to check if the username is `'admin'`. If it is, the condition `(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE username = 'admin') = 1` becomes true, and the authentication should proceed. If not, it becomes false."

    "### 6. SQL Injection Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities, it's highly recommended to use parameterized queries or [**prepared statements**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement) provided by the SQL library you are using (in this case, `sqlx`). Parameterized queries ensure that user inputs are treated as data rather than executable code, thus preventing SQL injection attacks. Let's explore the following example of how you might use parameterized queries with `sqlx`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let query_result = sqlx::query(\n",
    "    \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?\",\n",
    ")\n",
    ".bind(username)\n",
    ".bind(password);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the SQL library will handle the proper escaping and quoting of user inputs, making it resistant to SQL injection attacks. Always prioritize using parameterized queries or prepared statements to enhance the security of your application."
